NLP SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON AMAZON REVIEWS 

Abstract – A lot of times, companies want to understand the public opinion on their products and figure out what’s responsible for the growth and backfall. For better understanding, they perform sentiment analysis on their product reviews. Sentiment analysis has been on the rise because of the availability of new analysis techniques in deep learning, and there is an incomprehensibly large amount of data being generated everywhere. Every product review, every tweet, every reddit post, etc., contains subjective information which we would like to be able to process and understand. It helps the organization to recognize the primary issues with their products and to extract the instructive information from a large amount of data is crucial. In this project, we propose a deep neural network architecture using NLP techniques to evaluate the performance of proposed models in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, confusion matrix and classification report.
